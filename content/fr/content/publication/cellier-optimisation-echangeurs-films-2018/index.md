abstract: "We consider the heat transfer across a thin liquid film flowing by gravity along an tilted plane. This work aims at the identification of the mechanisms of heat transfer intensification and the optimization of the geometry of a plate exchanger. A simplified model based on weighted residual integral method applied to Navier Stokes and Fourier equations has been developed. A tool for solving system of partial derivative equations using the method of line has also been written. Spatial discretization is dealt with finite differences. A high order implicit Runge Kutta scheme with an adaptative time stepping, allows a stable and efficient resolution. This simplified model allowed us to link the fluid's dynamics (and especially the presence of recir- culations under traveling wave crests, alos called roll waves) with transfer intensification. This link has been confirmed solving the primitive equations . Indeed, a parametric study of the transfer inten- sification on a signature/representative element of an exchanger plate by a monochromatic frequency has been conducted showing that transfer intensification is related to the onset of roll waves. The effect of a variable wall goemetry has been included to the model. Preliminary work points out the need for a low inclination to yield a significant effect on transfer intensification."
